   * Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of

   * consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned to a
   * service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM
   * card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains,
   * and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and
   * information, and technology components.
   * <br/>A ResourceSpecification is a base class that represents a generic means
   * for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a
   * ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a
   * set of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is
   * based on a particular ResourceSpecification.
